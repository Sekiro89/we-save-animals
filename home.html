                    <p class="content ">Praveen Kumar L, also called Rider Praveen is an ex-gym instructor who gave up his job, his means of livelihood, all his and his family’s assets and savings to start We Save Animals (WSA) Welfare Trust. From paralysed, blind, old aged
                        animals to accident cases, cruelty cases and terminally ill animals - he takes them all in, giving them happiness, food and a home in his shelter. It started for Praveen in 2013, when he rescued a kitten with a spinal injury. He
                        nursed it at home, but it passed away after a week, leaving Praveen to wonder what he could do to help numerous animals like this, that suffer in silence. </p>

                    for their very existence! I thank Praveen for this noble cause he has taken up, something for which he has made many unimaginable sacrifices in his own life. Its a service not just to the animals in need but for humanity.</blockquote>

                    they roam freely and happily. Praveen is doing a good job keeping them free. All the animals enjoy their freedom with good, healthy food and a clean environment. The staff is very helpful too. Praveen is doing a really good job. He
                    is a Godfather for the animals.</blockquote>

                <p class="descip-info ">WSA provides shelter for sick, old and abandoned dogs, cats, cows and every other animal. The dogs are not chained or caged, they have enough space to walk, run, play and chase other dogs. At the shelter, it is indeed a dog's life! There
                    are only few cages in the shelter for those that are undergoing treatment.</p>

                <h4>Rescue and Rehab</h4>
                <p class="descip-info ">The best chance for India’s stray animals is to give them the care they need to fend for themselves on the street. SAFI uses the RRSR approach—Rescue, Rehab, Sterilize and Release—to give Indian dogs the best chance to fend for themselves
                    in the current climate. This allows us to give many more animals what they need without overwhelming the nation’s current shelter infrastructure, while our public education and abuse prevention arm works to build a society better suited
                    to the needs of these animals. Those animals whose age or medical issues render them unable to survive on the streets receive a forever home in a local sanctuary.</p>

                <p class="descip-info ">We are strictly a no-kill organization. SAFI’s shelter uses the RRNR approach – Rescue, Rehabilitate, Neuter, and Release. The ones who do not fit in the cycle remain in the sanctuary for life. Our paralyzed, disabled live in a separate
                    section with an indoor room, patio, outdoor covered area, and more room beyond. Paralyzed make a lot of mess all day. The entire area needs to clean almost 6 times a day. Your donation will help with dog food, vet care, flea tick medication,
                    staff salaries, utilities and more.</p>

                <p class="descip-info ">Each of our two teams has a minimum of one trained dog catcher, a vaccinator, a record keeper, and someone who applies paint to the dog once it is vaccinated so we do not vaccinate the same dog twice. If the dog cannot be caught by a local
                    feeder or by using treats to bribe them, our trained catchers use their skills to trap them with a net. We record how many dogs are vaccinated per area, if they are male or female, and if they have been spayed/neutered or not. The
                    goal is to hit a minimum of 70% of the dogs in each area. 70% is the number needed to eradicate rabies. </p>
